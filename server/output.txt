Dear jdjdjd,

I'm sending you this e-mail to inform you about the food you are about to cook on tuesday, 25/12/2018:

You will cook: meat
------------------------
Because:
you dont have money so prefer to cook the cheaper 'regular' meat than souvla.
always we go with the cheaper meal if we dont have money.
On a simple day you cook something with meat.
